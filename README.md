 The Shit I made to play Vorila/Dransik

Hotkeys
HotKeySet("{ins}", "mouse")
HotKeySet("{end}", "close")
HotKeySet("{del}", "check")
HotKeySet("{home}", "reset");this is Unused and will be removed in next github update
HotKeySet("{pgup}", "setup");this is Unused and will be removed in next github update
HotKeySet("{pgdn}", "setdwn");this is Unused and will be removed in next github update
HotKeySet("{home}", "gold")
HotKeySet("{pause}", "kill")






This is a Script made is Autoit (www.Autoit.com)

It will pickup gold and some drops, 

Hotkey sets location of pots

It will auto heal you to max heath (not using your mouse)
Cures in works

It force closes The client so no more waiting on close,
